      Heyyyy sweetheart,<br><br>
      I want to you to know that I'm extremely grateful to god for having you in my life. I don't know what I'd be doing without you, where I would be and how I would be as a person. You are an integral part of me and now that im going to the Philippines, I feel like im leaving a very huge part of me here in India.<br><br>
      
      I know Itâ€™s just 12 days but when it comes to you, even a few hours feels long. Youâ€™ve become such a huge part of my everyday that being apart, even for a little while feels strange, quiet and empty.<br><br>

      But I want you to know that Iâ€™m not really going anywhere. Iâ€™m still here thinking of you, missing you, carrying you with me in every little moment, by taking the polaroid of you in the back of my phonecase, sweatshirt and shirt that you gave me, So I feel at home.
      
      Whether Iâ€™m walking through a crowd or lying in bed at night, youâ€™re there. Always. In my heart and on my mind forever.<br><br>

      Please donâ€™t feel sad, baby. These days will pass before we know it. And when it does, Iâ€™ll be back first to come see you, hug you, kiss you and make up for every second I missed youðŸ¥º.<br><br>

      Youâ€™re my home. Youâ€™re my heart. And every day Iâ€™m away, Iâ€™ll be silently sending you all the love in the world from wherever I am, straight to where you are.<br><br>

      Go safely to work, eat nicely, stay happy, and wait for me. Iâ€™ll be back before you know it and when I am, Iâ€™ll hug you fully tightly. We'll go nicely belt food together heheheðŸ˜¼.<br><br>

      I love you more than words, more than time, more than miles.<br><br>

      You mean the whole world to me and more <br><br>

      Yours always ðŸ˜½,<br><br>


      Ayan ðŸ’—
    </p>
